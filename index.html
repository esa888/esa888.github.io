    <h1>This is our fashion house </h1>
<p>
    Belamour has been built in 1990, firstly in Barcelona 
    and then we expanded to other places such as Paris and
     Milano. We believe that fashion can be influenced by 
     different cultures, and that’s why we are always looking
      to expand in new places.
